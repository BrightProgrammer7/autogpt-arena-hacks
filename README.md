💻 Coding Excellence
🌐 Open-ended Agent Protocol

## 📋 Requirements
🌟 Clone AutoGPT 🌟
Start by cloning the AutoGPT repo - it's your ticket to success! 🚀 You'll get an amazing boilerplate that plays nicely with the benchmark, AutoGPT's user-friendly interface, and a bunch of monitoring and logging tools to supercharge your development journey. Let's get started!

## 📈 Benchmarking & Leaderboard 📈
As you forge ahead, constantly test your agent's performance against the benchmark. Our hackathon will be judged primarily based on these benchmarks. But guess what? We also have some awesome human judges ready to assess your brilliance when needed. 🧠💡 So show us what you've got, rockstars!

#### 🌟 General Challenge 🌟
💰 Prize: $15,000 Cash Prize 💰

The top-performing generalist agent will earn the prestigious title of the primary AutoGPT in our repository. Break all the boundaries, exceed those benchmarks, and let your excellence shine without any restrictions!

#### 💥 Scrape and Synthesize 💥
💰 Prize: $3,500 💰

Your mission, should you choose to accept it: extract data from the web and create datasets, summaries, and plans as requested. Can you handle the challenge?

#### 📊 Data Mastery 📊
💰 Prize: $3,500 💰

Become a data wizard by performing essential data science tasks like imputation, labeling, and sorting. Show us your data manipulation skills!
