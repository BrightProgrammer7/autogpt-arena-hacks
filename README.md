# Short-term TODO
So we have 3 weeks left. Lets get to work.


## Requirements

Everyone has had a chance to poke around the materials and tools available. So lets iron out the plan. We need a list of requirements for the project. These are the boxes that have to be ticked for the hack a thon.

-   Scrape and Synthesize
-   Data Mastery
-   Coding Excellence
-   Open-ended Agent Protocol

We want to make sure we hit all the sponsors. 

- AutoGPT
- Weviate
- Chroma
- MetaGPT

## Ideas

### Tonic's

Multi agent orchestration
Code stuff
Agent flow
Tree of thought
Add function calls
Rework the engine
UI
Multi media in
Multi media out

### Bako

Build a set of agents using modular tools, then break the agents down and let the orchestration model build new agents from pool of tools and preconstructed agents. I am going to focus on building a agent piloted web scraper that can collect data on a topic and generate a data set. This knocks out a bunch of sponsors and categories in one shot. I will make sure to keep it modular.

### Tooling

We are considering our tooling. The back end probably will be mostly in python and we are considering gradio or nextjs for the front end. We'd love thoughts and ideas on this.

### You Ideas

Comment on this to throw in your thoughts and ideas. Nothing is set in stone, we are still at the planning stage so dont be afraid to throw out ideas. Everything should be thrown at the walls and we'll see what sticks.
