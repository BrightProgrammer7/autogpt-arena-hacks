# Dataset Sythesizer

## Overview

Seems like a natural stepping off point will be to build a simple prompt / completion dataset generator for our orchestration model to be able to generate data sets to train models with

## TODO

- Create parsing algorithms to parse raw text data into a prompt and completion dataset.
- Create a simple UI for users to create their own data sets directly.
- Create a set of tools to allow agents to generate datasets for training.
- Create a pipeline to use existing api's like openai to finetune models for specialized taks.

## Blue sky

- Create more complex algorithms to parse data into more specialized datasets.
- Be able to generate image and audio data sets.
- Create a llm pipeline that is able to completely sythesize datasets using llms, image or audio models.
